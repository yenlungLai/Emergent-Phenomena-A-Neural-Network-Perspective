# Emergent-Phenomena-A-Neural-Network-Perspective



The recent surge in artificial intelligence owes much to the remarkable success of deep learning, powered by deep neural networks. Yet, amidst its triumphs, lingering questions persist regarding the challenges and true capabilities of these networks. In our paper, we venture into the realm of physical systems, with neural networks as our guiding light. We showcase how, without explicit training, even the most basic formâ€”linear neural networks, capable of unlocking insights into describing physical phenomena. Throughout our journey, where we consider time and the thermodynamics of interacting objects, we unveil the emergence of fundamental principles, including Newton's laws of gravity and Einstein's special relativity. Even phenomena like time dilation, the expansion of the universe, dark energy, and wormholes find proper explanation within our exploration, all through principle of locality.
